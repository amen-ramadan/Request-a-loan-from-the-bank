# Request a Loan from the Bank

This is an application for requesting a loan from the bank. You can access the application [here](https://request-a-loan-from-the-bank.vercel.app/).

## Details

This application validates form inputs and manages them in various formats. It connects the front-end and back-end with state management, meaning that the state is implicitly and visually linked to the input fields. 

The application manages re-rendering efficiently. It prompts the user to input their age and name, with the age restricted to between 18 and 100 years. If the age falls outside this range, an error message appears indicating that the input is invalid. Similarly, the mobile number input must be exactly 10 digits, otherwise, a rejection message is displayed. If all the input data is valid, a success message is shown to the user.

Feel free to explore the application and its functionality!
